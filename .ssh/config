  # Always use SSH2.
  Protocol 2
  # Use a shared channel for all sessions to the same host,
  # instead of always opening a new one. This leads to much
  # quicker connection times.
  #
  # NOTE HOWEVER: If you begin experiencing `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`
  # connection errors (when running `auth-refresh` script
  # on day two of using this setup), consider commenting out
  # these lines until a better solution is found. Search
  # http://g/macroadwarrior-guide if you want to learn more.
  # ALTERNATIVELY, when you get the `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` error
  # try running `ssh -O exit $your_desktop_machine_name`, to
  # make the problematic control session exit. The `auth-refresh`
  # script should now start working again.
